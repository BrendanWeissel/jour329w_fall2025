CNS Tag Browser

### Explore the Data
The firt note is that I could not get this to run with Cd'ing out of my personal folder. The way Trump is categorized should be standard, there are too many similar yet different tags like "President Trump" and "Donald Trump." These should be consolidated. 

For Baltimore there are too tage with the same exact name of Baltimore, not sure how that happened. In general there are way too many tags relating to Baltimore agencies, this should be simplified. 

### Planning Your Tag Browser

A feature to combine similair tags is the first thing I would do. I would start by being broader and then deciding what speicic niche categories are useful for CNS to have. I don't see a point in having hundreds of tags that have just one story in them. That is not the purpose of tags. It might be useful to filter for cities, political figures and government agencies. In addition I need to filter down the current options by looking for misspelling or different spellings of the same thing. 

 I went back into the weissel / cns_tag_browser directory
