 CNS Datasette Analysis 10/1/25- W
 
 What was the most interesting thing you saw doing this?
    I was most interested by being able to look back at my chat logs with an LLM. This is obviously a feature that would exist on the regular chatgpt webpage but the way we have been prompting them this would not be the case. I was mostly just unaware that this was being done and that it was something we could access. In the future it seems likely that integrating using the terminal with LLMs will become more widespread and this would be a feature that is given without needed to run any commands. 


- What was the most useful thing you saw doing this?
The level of organization Datasette provided for looking at Tags would be a useful way to manually understand the overuse of tags that CNS has used. Without a platform like this it would be very difficult to organize and see all the tags in one plans and the stories that correspond to them. 


- How useful was Datasette for this kind of analysis?
I would say that datasette seemed better for organiztion as compared to analysis. For example when we were searching for stories with specific words in them it was helpful. However the analysis piece did not seem as useful to me. The tool seemed better at structuring data rather than drawing insights. 


- What would you use this tool for in a newsroom? 
As we looked at last week this would be useful for creating embeddings. Datasette also seems like an effecient way to get and overview or stories for different time periods based on how it is organized. The biggest advantage is having all the important info about a story on one page so you could easily for example look at all titles and see how they can be imporoved or shorted. In a newsroom I would use this to keep track of our tags and find ways to improve them. 


- How does this compare to analyzing data in other tools?
    This tool seems most focused on organiztion rather than alaysis. Naturally this tool would be more helpfull with CNS if we included viewship data. For embeddings this tool seems great and I think it works for stuff like that when trying to get a general sense of the story. I would need to spend more time working with data analysis part to judge if I would use it over another software. As I said I am a big fan for using it for organization.
