 CNS Topic Analysis 10/3/25

 CNS story notes: 
 - A lot of local and national poltiics 
 - Focus on community and stories about specific people. Not necessarily feature stories but an empasises on using personal anecdotes to tell a story. 
 - Focus on local news, looking at the local peg to a national story'
 - more coverage on politcal movements than poltics themselves

Current topic analysis: 
The biggest issue with CNS tags I see right now is the amount of "throw away" tags that users added to because they had to. Very simply any tag that has "CNS" needs to be removed. The CNS tags have an identity crisis as some are very broad and others very specific. For example "Sports" is one of the most popular topics. A lot of the top topics include government info but some are general bodies like congress and others are specific people. I think having both of these are fine. The tag "hero" is one that should be cut and be more specific. The entire list needs to be formatted for syntax errors. Obviously Gov. and Governor should be the same tag. Also some outdated topics like "Maryland Newsline appear at the top of the list yet there has not been a story with that tag since 2019. The Maryland cities and specific politicans seem like the most important tags that people would look for. In local politics people are more likely to look for a specific politican as well as a place they are interested by. 
The entire CNS list could benefit from an overhaul with the syntax and being more specific. 

Consolidated list: 


1. Agriculture and Food
2. Annapolis
3. Armed Forces and National Security
4. Arts & Culture
5. Baltimore
6. Crime
7. Donald Trump
8. Education
9. Elections
10. Emergency Management
11. Environment
12. Economy
13. Federal Government and Politics
14. Health
15. Immigration
16. International Relations
17. Maryland Government and Politics
18. Science & Technology
19. Sports
20. Transportation and Public Works
21. Washington D.C.


How I made my list: I made my list by looking at which categories fall under another one, are not very important or can be comvined. I kept in mind the CNS audeicne, what topics are likely to be used often and SEO. I added Annapolis and Donald Trump as CNS has Annapolis coverage and the current president is an important figure people will search for. 


The following is the original list and how each topic was kept the same or changed: 

1. Agriculture and Food (KEPT)
2. Animals - Removed as it is not as relevant to a CNS audience and can fall under environment. 
3. Armed Forces and National Security (KEPT)
4. Arts & Culture (KEPT)
5. Civil Rights - CUT as it can fall under other categories and not as relevant to CNS
6. Commerce - Falls under econ
7. Congress - removed as it falls under federal gov 
8. Justice & Law - Change to crime 
9. Budget - falls under econ
10. Education (KEPT)
11. Elections (KEPT)
12. Emergency Management (KEPT)
13. Energy - cut, falls under other categories
14. Environmental Protection - combine with natural resouces and remove protection
15. Families - Cut not as relevant to a the CNS audience and can fall under other topics
16. Economy (KEPT and other fall under)
17. Trade - falls under econ
18. Maryland Government and Politics (KEPT)
19. Federal Government and Politics (KEPT)
20. Health (KEPT)
21. Housing - can fall under econ
22. Immigration (KEPT)
23. International Affairs - change to relations but KEPT. I like relations better and affairs can fall under more
24. Labor and Employment - fall under other stuff like econ 
25. Law - combined with crime, law is an odd topic to keep
26. Native Americans - cool topic, not nearly relevant enough for CNS
27. Natural Resources - falls under environment
28. Science & Technology (KEPT)
29. History - Not a CNS topic and a story will likely have another topic it falls under.
30. Social Welfare - cut, this is an odd topic that is not user friendly as not one would search for this. 
31. Sports (KEPT)
32. Taxes - combine with budget 
33. Transportation and Public Works (KEPT)
34. Chesapeake Bay - combine with natural resources topic and Annaplis was added
35. Baltimore (KEPT)









I asked Copilot and here is what it said. To be honest it was not super helpful and I did this mostly on my own: 

BrendanWeissel: Consider the CNS Maryland (https://cnsmaryland.org/) website. Here is the CNS about statement: Capital News Service is a student-powered news organization run by the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism. Since 1990, we have provided deeply reported, award-winning coverage of issues of import to Marylanders.

With bureaus in College Park, Annapolis and Washington run by professional journalists with decades of experience, we deliver news in multiple formats via partner news organizations, a destination website, an on-air television newscast, a weekly newsletter and affiliated social media platforms (including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and others).

We provide breaking news coverage, in-depth investigative and enterprise journalism — often in partnership with the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism — and serve as a laboratory for students to test and develop innovative new methods of reporting and telling stories.

By providing a true newsroom experience to our students, we send them into the job market with real-world skills and the ability to shape the future of journalism.

Only Merrill’s most motivated students are accepted into the Capital News Service program, and they go on to land internships and jobs at the nation’s finest news organizations: The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, the Associated Press, Politico, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, ProPublica, National Geographic, NBC News, The Dallas Morning News, the Washington City Paper, Washingtonian magazine, Money magazine, the Wall Street Journal and more.

#### Explanations for Consolidation

- **Justice, Law, Civil Rights**: These often overlap in coverage (e.g., court cases, civil rights issues, legal reforms), so combining clarifies the scope.
- **Economy, Commerce, Trade, Labor & Employment**: These are tightly linked in Maryland news (jobs, business, trade policy, labor issues).
- **Budget & Taxes**: Budget stories almost always involve taxes and vice versa.
- **Housing, Social Welfare, Families**: These topics intersect in stories about poverty, homelessness, and family policy.
- **Environmental Protection, Natural Resources, Chesapeake Bay**: Chesapeake Bay is Maryland’s signature environmental issue, but most stories fit under a broader environment/natural resources umbrella.
- **Energy & Science/Technology**: Energy coverage often involves technology and innovation.
- **Transportation & Public Works**: These are typically covered together in infrastructure stories.
- **Armed Forces, National Security, International Affairs**: Maryland’s military presence and related security/international issues are often linked.
- **Agriculture, Food & Animals**: These are frequently combined in rural and food policy reporting.
- **Arts, Culture & History**: These topics overlap in coverage of Maryland’s heritage and cultural events.
- **Baltimore**: Kept as a standalone due to its unique news volume and importance.
- **Native American Affairs**: Kept for Maryland-specific relevance.
- **Emergency Management**: Remains distinct due to disaster and crisis coverage.
- **Congress**: Kept separate due to Maryland’s federal delegation and frequent coverage.

**Subtopics**: Some high-volume areas (e.g., Chesapeake Bay, Labor & Employment, Science & Technology) can be tracked as subtopics if needed.

**Summary:**  
This consolidation reduces redundancy, clarifies topic boundaries, and aligns with CNS’s Maryland-centric coverage. Overlapping or rarely used categories were merged or made subtopics, while high-frequency Maryland-specific topics (like Baltimore and Chesapeake Bay) are retained or highlighted.
